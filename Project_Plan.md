# Project Plan
## Goal
Design a program that should automatically recognize a face. From an input image of an unknown face, the program
should detect the face, extract relevant features and make a decision if the face in the image
belongs to a known person and, if so, to whom? If the unknown face corresponds to a person not in the known database, 
the program should recognize this and deny access.
